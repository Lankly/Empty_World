Gameplay
--------

  You are an adventurer, represented by the symbol '@'. You MAP everything that you see as you walk by it, but don't know anything beyond that. You carry around everything that you pick up in an INVENTORY, and can use those items at any time. You NAVIGATE the map with the numpad. For converting to hjklyubn movement, consult Section 3.

  Your character traits are represented by S.P.E.C.I.A.L:
    - Strength: Governs how forcefully you interact with the world
    - Perception: Determines how far and how well you can sense the world
    - Endurance: Determines how the world interacts with you
    - Charisma: Governs how well you interact with other intelligent beings
    - Intelligence: Determines how capable you are of figuring things out
    - Agility: Determines how quickly you move
    - Luck: Affects everything you do

   Other infomation you need to keep track of is HEALTH and HUNGER. How healthy you are is indicated by your health. If you are physically damaged, poisioned, electrocuted, etc, you will lose health. If this number reaches 0, you will die. When your health falls below half of your maximum possible health, this part of your status bar will be highlighted yellow. If it falls to below 20% of your max health, it will be highlighted red.
    Hunger represents how much food is in your stomach right now. Your stomach can only become so full, however. Anything beyond your limit and you will PURGE your food, up to 20%. You will notice that hunger is a fairly large number. This is due to the fact that the number decreases every turn cycle.

   As you navigate the dungeons, you will encounter MONSTERS. Monsters wander around the map, and depending on the kind, will attack or help you. Some will simply leave you alone. Killing a monster places its corpse and all items it was carrying onto the floor. Monsters have S.P.E.C.I.A.L. traits just like you do, as well as ABILITIES intrinsic to their race, and will not be all the same. Be careful!

   ITEMS can be used in several ways. The first are weapons. Any item can be WIELDED as a weapon. When you move into an enemy, you will attack that creature with either your fists, or with whatever item you have wielded. This will deal damage to that creature proportional to how useful the item is as a weapon. If you attempt to attack a creature that is friendly to you, you will be prompted first.
    The next way to use items is to EAT or QUAFF (drink) them. If the item is a not small enough to be swallowed, or is not a drink, you will be unable to eat or quaff them, respectively. Food items will increase the amount of food in your stomach. Drinkable items may have some kind of special (temporary) effect on you.
    The third way to use an item is to EQUIP it to yourself. This will place that item on its proper spot on your body. Only wearable items may be equipped. Typically, a worn item will increase your ARMOR CLASS and, in combition with Endurance, help decrease the amount of damage that you take for certain kinds of damage.
    The fourth way that an item can be used is to ZAP it. This can only be done to wands. The wand will then produce some effect if is has charges left. Charges to wands can be restored by praying to a God, conducting electricity, or by transferring them from one wand to another (not all wands are compatible with each other!).
    The final way to use an item is to generally USE it. Not every item will have an intrisic way to use it beyond the above, but some can only be interacted with in this way. What the item does depends on the item.
