Story

  The world ended almost one hundred years ago. The Gods of Death, Kruzup and Rigalia, rained Cosmic Fire from the heavens upon the Earth, reducing every living thing on the surface to ashes. Some survived in caves, mines, and even deep underground cities, but the world would never be the same again. More than half of those who survived the Cosmic Fire succame to hunger and thirst. Settlements' populations dwindled and now it is rare to find more than a handful of people living in any given place.

  This is in this world in which you were born. Your mother often told you stories while you were growing up of the Old World that she had been told by her mother before her. That was before the cave-in. Now, you've been wandering from cave to cave for years. Today, you set out into the wastes with a strange feeling in your gut.
