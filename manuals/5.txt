  The main game is written by me, GitHub user Lankly. I have received advice and assistance in execution from GitHub user hatkirby.

  This game uses NCURSES and is written in C. My text editor of choice is Emacs.

  The game's ASCII-art name was taken from http://patorjk.com/ and uses the 'Ogre' font with slight modification.

  I would like to thank the following testers:
